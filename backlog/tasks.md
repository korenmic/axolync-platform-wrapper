# Android Wrapper Backlog

- [x] Restore native debug archive save in the active Capacitor host so browser-generated debug ZIP exports land in a truthful Android-visible location and return structured `{ success, uri, error }` results instead of falling back to fragile WebView blob-download behavior.

- [x] Replace Android debug archive save's dependency on the native service companion bridge with a dedicated Capacitor-native save capability.
  - The current failure shape still reaches `Native debug archive save requested` and then dies with `Capacitor native service companion bridge is unavailable.`, which proves debug archive export is still coupled to the broader native companion bootstrap instead of standing on its own.
  - Give debug archive save its own dedicated Capacitor plugin/capability path rather than routing it through `AxolyncNativeServiceCompanionHost`.
  - Prefer the standard Capacitor plugin publication path for this dedicated save capability so Android file export is not blocked by native proxy/native companion bootstrap failures.
  - Preserve truthful Android-visible save semantics and the structured `{ success, uri, error }` result contract for browser.
  - Keep the operator-facing target explicit: a successful Android save should return a truthful URI/location for the written archive rather than silently falling back to a best-effort WebView blob download.

- [x] Block Android WebView text selection and contextual copy/translate menus outside explicitly editable or debug-copy surfaces.
  - The shipped APK currently allows long-press text selection and the Android copy/translate toolbar on app UI text, which violates the wrapper interaction policy.
  - Enforce the Android-specific suppression in the Capacitor host/WebView layer where possible, and use browser-side wrapper-scoped CSS/event guards only when needed.
  - Do not break normal typing/selecting inside real text inputs or any explicit debug-log copy/export affordance that Axolync intentionally provides.
  - Add Android wrapper proof that long-press selection/contextual action mode is suppressed on ordinary app text while input fields still behave correctly.

- [x] Classify Capacitor loopback route mismatches that return HTML to native runtime callers.
  - Diagnose whether Android Capacitor native operator requests can be routed to the wrong WebView asset/server path and return `<!doctype` HTML instead of native JSON.
  - Add Android-owned diagnostics that distinguish cleartext/mixed-content blocks, unreachable loopback, wrapper asset-server HTML, route miss, and operator-side request handling.
  - Fix Android routing only if the HTML response originates from Capacitor/WebView transport or wrapper route publication, without weakening the working Tauri loopback shape.
  - Add proof that native runtime loopback calls either reach the intended operator route or produce a classified Android transport failure.

- [x] Respect the generated notification feature flag and suppress Android notification capture when disabled.
  - Consume the builder/browser projected notification feature flag in the Capacitor host.
  - When disabled, do not request, initialize, register, or expose the old Android notification-listener/status-bar capture capability to browser runtime.
  - Keep Android debug ZIP save and other native capabilities unaffected.
  - Add wrapper-level proof that a disabled profile does not publish notification capture availability while an explicit future enabled profile still can.

- [x] Prevent LRCLIB-native Android APK startup crashes from staged native payload failures.
  - Treat the latest manual report as a hard Android wrapper bug: the LRCLIB-native preinstall APK does not launch at all, while the normal APK without native LRCLIB launches.
  - Reproduce and isolate whether the crash happens during asset enumeration, native companion registry parsing, Brotli/SQLite dependency initialization, DB deploy setup, loopback server preparation, or WebView bootstrap.
  - Make all LRCLIB native companion startup/deploy failures lazy and failure-contained: the app must still launch, mark LRCLIB native unavailable, expose diagnostics, and allow remote LRCLIB fallback rather than crashing the process.
  - Preserve working normal APK startup and existing Vibra native companion behavior.
  - Add a non-device startup regression proof where possible, plus report validation that fails if an LRCLIB-native Android artifact contains a startup-fatal native payload configuration.

- [x] Harden the desktop Electron wrapper against Chromium GPU process startup failure.
  - Disable Electron hardware acceleration before `app.whenReady()` so GPU process startup failures do not terminate the release wrapper before the app shell is usable.
  - Keep an explicit environment escape hatch for local diagnostics.
  - Add wrapper-level proof that the hardening runs before Electron readiness.

- [x] Verify and harden LRCLIB native runtime support across Tauri and Capacitor wrappers.
  - Land this in a dedicated platform-wrapper PR so wrapper runtime support is reviewed independently from addon and browser fixes.
  - Verify the Sinq4-local platform-wrapper checkout contains active `lrclib-local-loopback-v1` runtime dispatch for Tauri and Capacitor, not only Electron.
  - Add or update wrapper-side proof that valid LRCLIB native payload descriptors can be registered, started, queried, and failure-contained on supported wrappers.
  - If an actual wrapper runtime gap is found, fix it in the wrapper repo rather than masking it in browser or LRCLIB addon code.
  - Ensure unsupported browser/web hosts remain truthfully unsupported while Tauri/Capacitor wrappers expose actionable diagnostics for bridge, route, DB deploy, and server startup failures.
