# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies requirements for the Android APK Wrapper that hosts the Axolync karaoke companion experience. The wrapper will package the existing web-based Axolync platform (axolync-browser v1.0.0) into a native Android application while preserving all existing functionality including the state machine, plugin pipeline, and user experience semantics.

## Glossary

- **Axolync_Browser**: The web-based karaoke companion platform that serves as the baseline for this wrapper
- **Android_Wrapper**: The native Android application that hosts the Axolync experience
- **WebView**: The Android component that renders web content within the native app
- **Plugin_Pipeline**: The 3-plugin system (SongSense, SyncEngine, LyricFlow) that processes audio and synchronizes lyrics
- **State_Machine**: The exact state model and transitions defined in axolync-browser v1.0.0 (source of truth), including state names and transition semantics
- **Local_Runtime**: The execution environment for the web application within the Android wrapper
- **Mic_Capture**: Audio input from the device microphone for song identification
- **Splash_Screen**: Initial loading screen displayed during app startup
- **Plugin_Package**: Installable/updatable plugin components stored on Android storage
- **Offline_Mode**: Operation mode where the app functions without network connectivity
- **Online_Mode**: Operation mode where the app requires network connectivity

## Requirements

4. THE Android_Wrapper SHALL handle Android lifecycle events (pause, resume, background, foreground)

### Requirement 3: Microphone Permissions and Capture

**User Story:** As a user, I want to grant microphone access to the app, so that it can listen to and identify songs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

### Requirement 4: State Machine Preservation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the state machine to function identically to the web version, so that behavior is consistent across platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. A state-transition parity test suite SHALL verify Android behavior against v1.0.0 baseline traces
3. THE Android_Wrapper SHALL maintain all state transition semantics identical to axolync-browser
4. THE Android_Wrapper SHALL use state names exactly as defined in the axolync-browser v1.0.0 state machine specification

### Requirement 5: Plugin Pipeline Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the song identification and lyric synchronization to work on Android, so that I can use all karaoke companion features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Android_Wrapper SHALL execute the SongSense plugin for audio analysis
2. THE Android_Wrapper SHALL execute the SyncEngine plugin for timeline synchronization
3. THE Android_Wrapper SHALL execute the LyricFlow plugin for lyric rendering

5. THE Android_Wrapper SHALL store Plugin_Package files on Android storage
6. THE Android_Wrapper SHALL provide a mechanism for Plugin_Package installation
7. THE Android_Wrapper SHALL provide a mechanism for Plugin_Package updates
8. Plugin_Package installation SHALL verify package integrity using signature or checksum validation
9. IF a Plugin_Package update fails, THEN THE Android_Wrapper SHALL rollback to the previous working version
10. THE Android_Wrapper SHALL document the storage location and permission model for Plugin_Package files
11. IF a Plugin_Package is corrupt or invalid, THEN THE Android_Wrapper SHALL provide deterministic error UX and prevent partial activation

### Requirement 6: Content Delivery Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to choose an appropriate architecture for serving web content, so that the app performs optimally on Android devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Android_Wrapper SHALL serve the web application content to the WebView
2. THE Android_Wrapper v1 SHALL use bundled static assets served from Android app storage
3. THE Android_Wrapper SHALL load the web application within a WebView component
4. THE Android_Wrapper SHALL serve all core web app assets from internal app storage; external network requests MAY be used for online-dependent plugin/provider operations

### Requirement 7: Network Connectivity Modes

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work in different network conditions, so that I can use it regardless of connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Android_Wrapper v1 SHALL require online connectivity for song identification and lyric synchronization
2. IF network connectivity is unavailable, THEN THE Android_Wrapper SHALL display a connectivity status message with clear guidance
3. THE Android_Wrapper SHALL detect network availability before attempting song identification
4. THE Android_Wrapper SHALL handle transitions between online and offline states gracefully
5. WHEN transitioning from online to offline, THE Android_Wrapper SHALL preserve current state and display appropriate UX feedback

### Requirement 8: Audio Routing and Quality

**User Story:** As a user, I want high-quality audio capture with minimal latency, so that song identification is accurate and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Android_Wrapper SHALL route audio from the device microphone to Mic_Capture
2. Audio path initialization latency (start action to first captured chunk available to plugin pipeline) SHALL be <= 150 ms on target device profile
3. Cold start to first render SHALL be 3 seconds or less on target device class (mid-range Android devices from 2019+ with 4GB RAM)
4. Mic_Capture start latency SHALL be 150ms or less after permission grant and start action

1. WHEN the app is paused, THE Android_Wrapper SHALL suspend Mic_Capture
2. WHEN the app is resumed, THE Android_Wrapper SHALL restore Mic_Capture if previously active
3. WHEN the app is sent to background, THE Android_Wrapper SHALL preserve application state
4. WHEN the app is brought to foreground, THE Android_Wrapper SHALL restore application state
