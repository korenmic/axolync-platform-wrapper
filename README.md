# Axolync Android Wrapper

Target wrapper authority: `axolync-platform-wrapper`.

This checkout is still named `axolync-android-wrapper` during rename/refactor migration. Treat the old name as a compatibility alias only. See [docs/wrapper-platform-authority.md](docs/wrapper-platform-authority.md) and [config/wrapper-authority.json](config/wrapper-authority.json).

## Migration Status

This README describes the active Capacitor-based Android host introduced by Migration 05.

- Active migration target: Capacitor-based Android host
- Legacy reference doc: [docs/legacy/embedded-wrapper-reference.md](docs/legacy/embedded-wrapper-reference.md)
- Legacy state label: `archived-reference`

Treat the embedded-server architecture as archived legacy behavior. The active host path in this repository is now the thin Capacitor shell described below.

Native Android shell for the Axolync web app.

## What This Project Does

- Packages `axolync-browser` web assets into an APK.
- Stages browser build artifacts into Capacitor public assets.
- Uses a thin Capacitor `BridgeActivity` host instead of a custom localhost server or Kotlin-owned product runtime.
- Defers Android-native integrations that need custom native plugins until later bridge-plugin work lands.
- Preserves Axolync state-machine/UI behavior from the web app baseline.

## Runtime Flow

1. Builder/browser outputs are staged into `app/src/main/assets/public`.
2. `MainActivity` launches as a Capacitor `BridgeActivity`.
3. Capacitor loads the staged web app assets directly from the packaged host shell.
4. Browser JS runs in the mobile host baseline without requiring `AndroidBridge`, a localhost server, or embedded Python in the active path.

## Project Structure

- `config/wrapper-authority.json` - target wrapper authority identity and compatibility alias policy
- `docs/wrapper-platform-authority.md` - promotion/rename policy for `axolync-platform-wrapper`
- `app/src/main/kotlin/com/axolync/android/`
  - `activities/MainActivity.kt` - thin Capacitor host activity
- `app/src/main/res/`
  - `xml/config.xml` - Capacitor host config
  - `xml/file_paths.xml` - file-provider compatibility config
- `app/src/main/assets/public/` - staged browser build used by the Capacitor host
- `app/src/main/assets/capacitor/` - checked-in Capacitor asset metadata
- `scripts/stage-browser-assets.mjs` - stages browser outputs into Capacitor assets
- `deprecated/.kiro/specs/android-apk-wrapper/` - archived pre-Capacitor localhost-era requirements/design/tasks

## Build and Test

```bash
# Install Capacitor dependencies
npm ci --no-fund --no-audit

# Unit tests
./gradlew :app:testNormalDebugUnitTest

# Build both normal + demo debug APKs
./gradlew :app:assembleNormalDebug :app:assembleDemoDebug
```

APK output:
- `app/build/outputs/apk/normal/debug/app-normal-debug.apk`
- `app/build/outputs/apk/demo/debug/app-demo-debug.apk`

## Debug Signing Stability

- Debug builds use the tracked keystore at `signing/axolync-debug.keystore`.
- This keeps debug APK upgrade lineage stable across machines instead of falling back to each host's local `~/.android/debug.keystore`.
- Release builds remain outside this debug-key path.

## Local Parity Debugging

To debug the staged browser output on desktop, use the browser repo or the builder report artifacts directly. The active Android host no longer depends on a localhost asset server inside the APK.

## Asset Sync From axolync-browser

`preBuild` depends on `stageCapacitorBrowserAssets`.
It copies:
- builder/browser normal output into `app/src/main/assets/public/`
- builder/browser demo assets into `app/src/main/assets/public/demo/assets/`
- Capacitor compatibility stubs (`cordova.js`, `cordova_plugins.js`) when missing

## Permissions

- `RECORD_AUDIO`
- `MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS`
- `INTERNET`
- `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`

## Important Notes

- Phase 1 intentionally drops native-only capabilities that require custom bridge plugins.
- SongSense notification-reader behavior is deferred in the active Capacitor baseline.
- If mobile behavior differs from the browser baseline, treat that as a host capability gap to be reintroduced explicitly later, not as a reason to restore hidden localhost/native-bridge assumptions.
